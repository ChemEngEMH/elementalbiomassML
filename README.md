Model for biomass classification and prediction of elemental analysis
1. Use the logistic regression model to classify biomass sample into cluster 0,1,2 or 3 based on the proximate analysis and heating value as inputs.
2. Add to your data the classification given in step 1, then use the ANN model to predict elemental analysis.
3. Done!
